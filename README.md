PRO-DIVE PLANNER (dos) and VGM ProPlanner (VB)
The above applications are hopefully the most recent versions of each application.
In each folder there are the following subfolders;
    /output         executables/installers
    /screenshots    some shots taken during execution
    
Also a folder "Other unrecognised versions" containing what looks to be other versions of the same two applications above, for archive purposes.
