Decompression is a physiologically complicated event. There are many factors that affect how well the human body decompresses and how well it is able to withstand pressure exposures. All dive algorithms have been devised to combine the complexity and risk of staying in the water with the risk of decompression sickness after surfacing. Things like hydration before a dive, and rest and hydration and even oxygen after a dive all help reduce the risk of DCS. So bear in mind that as with all decompression planning there needs to be a balance and understanding of the risk of reducing decompression times and the impact of DCS. Please refer to your training agencies’ information and advice on these issues.
