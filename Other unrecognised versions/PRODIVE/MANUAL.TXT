WAIVER

Pro Planner is designed as a tool for planning decompression schedules for
use with Oxygen, Nitrogen and Helium. By using this software the user
accepts full responsibility for any incidents occurring while executing
dives to any schedule calculated by this software.

Pro Planner does not warn where bad diving practice may occur as a
result of a planned sequence.

Always follow the basic rules:

  Deepest dive first.

  No 'yo-yo' dive profiles.  Recent research indicates that these
  exaggerated profiles may lead to type 2 DCI even when the diver is
  inside the no stop times on the  tables.

  Especially on high exposure dives, make no more than two dives a day, with  
  a day off in a sequence of days diving.

  Avoid Carbon Dioxide build-up caused by over-work and/or inadequate
  breathing equipment.

  Avoid dehydration.

Pro Planner will display both CNS and Pulmonary toxicity numbers. The user
is reminded that Oxygen toxicity varies from person to person and day to
day. A divers tolerance to Oxygen is greatly reduced by exercise (CO2 build
up) and/or inadequate breathing equipment.

For more details on Oxygen limits the user is directed to either the NOAA
or IANTD Nitrox manuals. Oxygen toxicity is a science in itself and the
user must be fully conversant with the tolerance limits.  This software
cannot compensate in any way for over-stepping those limits; it will only
calculate current values using established methods.

Full and complete training is essential for all diving.  Further specialist 
training in nitrox, tri-mix, and rebreather techniques is imperative before 
attempting any dives with these specialist mixes.

                               INSTRUCTIONS

Pro Planner (PP) is simple to operate and comes in three upgradable versions:
AIR/NITROX, TRIMIX, and RE-BREATHERS.

INSTALLATION
PP can be run from a floppy drive or be copied onto the hard drive of a PC.
To install PP onto a PC simply type "INSTALL" with the disc in the floppy
drive.  PP will automatically create a directory called Prodive (if you
already have a directory called Prodive you may wish to rename it). To  run
PP go to the directory and type PLAN.

Once installed, you will be asked to accept the liability waiver by
entering your name and address on the front screen.

It is important you keep the master disc safe, as any upgrades can only
issued by returning this disc. Any attempts to copy this disc may result in
corruption of the algorithm and version log. In doing so you may also loose
your right to any free upgrades.

FRONT SCREEN
Having registered your copy you will be asked to select one of the options.
If an option is not accessible you may need to purchase another version
(i.e. if you have bought the Air/nitrox version, Trimix is disabled).

Options include:

1   AIR
  With  the  Air  option,  79%  N2/21% O2 is  automatically  assumed  as  the
  breathing gas.
  PPO2 and OTU's are displayed, as is tissue load. This is updated at the end
  of each dive and at the end of surface interval.
  As  with  all  options HELP is available in the top right of  the  planning
  screen.

2  NITROX
  Any  combination of N2 and O2 can be used here, either during the dive, at
  stops or between dives at the surface. Maximum Oxygen content 100%.

3  TRIMIX
  Any combination of N2, He and O2 can be used here, either during the dive,
  at stops or between dives at the surface.

4  NITROX RE-BREATHER plus New Bailout planning
  This assumes a closed circuit Re breather and works by entering a PPO2.  If
  no PPO2 is entered the system assumes 1.40Bar. At depths less than the
  selected PPO2 the software will assume the maximum for that depth. The maximum 
  PPO2 that can be entered is 2.00bar

  To enter a bailout mode, enter 'b' or 'B' when prompted for PPO2 during
  dive details entry. This will then prompt for bailout gas details. The
  default for the bailout gas is air.
  Once bailout mode has been activated, the bailout gas will be prompted for 
  instead of diluent. To return back to closed circuit, enter 'c' or 'C' when
  prompted for O2 entry.

5  HELIOX RE-BREATHER plus New Bailout planning
  This assumes a closed circuit Re breather and works by entering a PPO2.  If
  no PPO2 is entered the system assumes 1.40Bar. At depths less than the
  selected PPO2 the software will assume the maximum for that depth. The maximum 
  PPO2 that can be entered is 2.00bar

  To enter a different diluent mix, enter He and O2 percentages when prompted
  during dive details entry. The diluent O2 default for the first depth is 
  determined from the PPO2 rebreather setpoint entered. Thereafter, the 
  default is the last value entered, or the maximum achievable if the inert 
  gas percentages have changed.

  To enter a bailout mode, enter 'b' or 'B' when prompted for PPO2 during
  dive details entry. This will then prompt for bailout gas details. The
  default for the bailout gas is the diluent.
  Once bailout mode has been activated, the bailout gas will be prompted for 
  instead of diluent. To return back to closed circuit, enter 'c' or 'C' when
  prompted for O2 entry.

6  UNITS (Feet, Metres)
  The currently displayed units are used on screen. To change select  6.

7  SAVE
  To save a planned dive to disc, enter a name (a list of currently stored
  dives is shown).

8  RESTORE\REVIEW
  This function allows several features to be accessed; 
  1.    Mission creating.
        In order to add dives to a preplanned dive sequence the user
        simply recalls the planned dive using this option. Having then 
        selected one of the planning options (1 to 5). You are asked if 
        you wish to append this new dive to the sequence.  

***Important*** If a planned mission is to include air, Nitrox and Trimix 
                dives, then the Trimix option should be used throughout.
                When an air or Nitrox dive is planned, obviously the
                Helium content is left out. You cannot start the mission 
                using the air option and then switch to Trimix part way.
                Up to 10 dives may be planned in a mission.

  2.   While reviewing the planned dive you may print the 
       decompression schedule. 

  3.   While reviewing the dive you may select to calculate 
       total gas volume requirements. Simply follow the prompts.
  
9  SAFETY FACTOR
  By typing in a safety factor, the total inert gas component in the mix is
  increased by 1% for every 5% entered.  This safety percentage does not apply
  when at the surface, only when diving.

A  ATMOSPHERIC
  Warning!  Adjustment of atmospheric pressure will seriously affect your
  decompression schedule.  See notes in the specification section for 
  pressure ranges.

B  BREATHING RATE
   Enter your surface breathing rate. This is used in the gas volume 
   calculations.

C  CYLINDER FILLING
  For Nitrox and Trimix dives this function allows you to enter the fill
  pressure of a cylinder, the % of each gas and use partial pressure
  mathematics to calculate the fill pressures of each gas (Air is assumed
  rather than pure Nitrogen).
  Another function allows you to enter an equivalent Narcosis depth, PPO2
  target and dive depth. Gas percentages will then be calculated.

S  Last Stop
  This allows the final stop in a decompression sequence to be performed at          
  6m/20ft, 4.5m/15ft, or 3m/10ft.  Some recent research has shown that the 
  3m/10ft is the least safest stop to perform, and a safety advantage 
  would be gained by doing an extended 6m/20ft stop or 4.5/15m stop instead.
  Enter S to toggle between the choices.
  If the 4.5/15ft stop is used, then an asterix * is shown against the stop.

T  TIME OF DAY
  If no start time is entered the system assumes 00:00 hours on day 1 as the
  mission start time.  Time of day can be entered in order to calculate
  mission end times.

  The software runs three time line systems.
  1.    Bottom time and Time at Stops
        Descent is assumed to be included in bottom time and time at
        each individual stop is shown. Time to surface reflects ascent rates.
  2.    Run Time.
        This is time from leaving surface to the end of each depth change.
  3.    Decompression Time.
        Time from leaving bottom to end of each stop.

P  Printer type and format
  Pro-Planner can print to a dot matrix or Laser jet printer. On the Laser 
  jet, the format can be Portrait or Landscape. 
  Press P to toggle to the printer and format of your choice.

O  Gas Optimize "NEW"
  Gas Optimize allows the PPO2 of the open circuit mix to be kept within a 
  range. An upper and lower limit of PPO2 is selected. Then during the dive, 
  the default return value for the O2% will be forced to be within the PPO2 
  limits. If the last O2% is within the range then this will be the default.
  If not, then a new O2% is calculted so as to give the upper limit PPO2. If
  the upper and lower limit are the same, then the default O2% for each 
  depth will effectively give a fixed PPO2 for the dive.

M  MANUAL
  This manual is displayed on the screen, and can be printed out if required.
  The manual is held in a read-only text file called MANUAL.TXT, and can 
  also be viewed by from the DOS prompt by using: TYPE MANUAL.TXT | MORE

U  BUBBLES
  Toggles the moving bubbles ON and OFF the screen.

0  Exit.
  Quits the programme.
